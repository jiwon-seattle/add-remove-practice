    <p>The cat or domestic cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.</p>
    <p> It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.</p>
    <p>he cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet; or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact.</p>
    <p>A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Size</li>
      <p>Domestic cats are smaller than wildcats in both skull and limb measurements. Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 10 lb).</p>
    <li>Skeleton</li>
      <p>Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).</p>
    <li>Skull</li>
      <p>The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.</p>

    <li>Vision</li>

      <p>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.</p>


    <li>Smell</li>
      <p>Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 cm2 (0.90 in2) in area, which is about twice that of humans.</p>
